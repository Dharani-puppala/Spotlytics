# VIZ-GPT: Spotify Data Visualization Project

This project demonstrates the integration of Spotify's data into various visualization tools, including Power BI, HTML, and Deneb. The project focuses on cleaning and transforming Spotify data, adding album cover images, integrating glassmorphism backgrounds, and displaying advanced visualizations.

## Steps Overview

### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation (ChatGPT)
- A new column called "Album Cover" was added to the dataset, containing URLs of the album cover images for each song.
- Data transformations were performed to enhance the dataset by adding relevant columns like album cover URLs.

### Step 2: Dataset Manipulation (Python)
- Signed up for a developer account at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/) and created a new application to obtain the `client_id` and `client_secret`.
- Ran the Python script (with file encoding "ISO-8859-1") to fetch and manipulate Spotify data and updated the dashboard with the required information.

### Step 3: Glassmorphism Background (PPT)
- Utilized PowerPoint to design a visually appealing glassmorphism background for the project. This style is used to provide a frosted glass-like effect for UI elements.

### Step 4: Power BI Integration
- Loaded the transformed data into Power BI, adding new columns (like date) and creating various visualizations (graphs, charts) for the dashboard.
- Incorporated basic Power BI measures to enhance the report with meaningful insights.

### Step 5: Bravo for Power BI
- Created a Date table in Power BI using the Bravo feature.
- Integrated this Date table with the Spotify dataset to enable time-based analysis and improve reporting.

### Step 6: HTML Visuals Integration
- Integrated HTML content within Power BI to display album cover images. HTML code was used to generate visuals that dynamically display cover images for selected albums.

### Step 7: Deneb Visuals Integration
- Integrated Deneb (a Power BI visual) to add advanced charting options like heat maps and unit charts, improving the dashboard's interactivity and analysis capabilities.

### Step 8: Power BI Finalization
- Edited and organized the Power BI dashboard to ensure clean and insightful visualizations. The final version was polished for optimal user experience and presentation.
